## About The Project

DCS-BIOS is an `Export.lua` script for use with [DCS: World][dcs-url], enabling external hardware and software to interact with the clickable cockpit of a DCS aircraft.

> [!NOTE]
> DCS-Skunkworks DCS-BIOS is a continuation of the [original DCS-BIOS][original-dcs-bios-url], which is no longer updated.

## Getting Started

Getting started with DCS-BIOS is easy! Just follow these simple steps. 

### Prerequisites

#### Find your DCS Scripts folder

Start by finding your DCS Saved Games folder. On Windows, this is likely either:
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\DCS`
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta`

Within that folder, you find the folder called `Scripts`. Create one if it does not exist. The final path should look like:
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\DCS\Scripts`
- `C:\Users\USERNAME\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\Scripts`

### Installation

> [!Note]
> The process for updating DCS-BIOS is exactly the same as installing it.

1. Go to the [latest release][latest-release-url]
2. Download `DCS-BIOS_x.y.z.zip`
3. Extract the zip file
4. Within the extracted folder, copy the `DCS-BIOS` folder into the previously mentioned scripts folder.
5. **If your Scripts folder does not have an `Export.lua` file**, copy the `Export.lua` file over
6. **If your scripts folder _does_ have an `Export.lua` file**, add the following line to the end 
```dofile(lfs.writedir() .. [[Scripts\DCS-BIOS\BIOS.lua]])```

> [!Tip]
> Still having trouble? Check out our [wiki][wiki-url], ask a question in [Discussions][discussions-url] or get in touch on [Discord][discord-url].

## Usage

### Panel Builders

Arduino Users should download the `Source code (zip)` on the Release page to get all needed files.

You don't need to be a programmer or electrical engineer to build your own panels. The [DCS-BIOS User Guide][user-guide-url] includes step-by-step instructions on how to connect your panel to DCS using DCS-BIOS and the beginner-friendly [Arduino microcontroller platform](http://arduino.cc). You don't have to write any code yourself.

#### Connect DCS-BIOS stream to your serial ports

Both `socat` and [DCSBIOSBridge](dcsbiosbridge-url) can be used to connect to your device.

> [!Important]
> If using `socat`, the files in the .zip file must be unzipped directly in the socat folder. The path **must** be `/socat/socat.exe`

#### Debugging

If you are working a lot with hardware, it may come in handy to log and replay dcs-bios data. There are two scripts in [Programs/tools](Programs/tools/) that allow you to do so.

`python connect-logger.py` will log all dcs-bios data to `dcsbios_data.json`. Ensure that you start the logger before loading a mission in order to capture the mission-start message properly.

`python replay-log.py` will ask for a serial port like `connect-serial-port.cmd` and replay the data to that com-port. When it reaches the end of the file, it will loop forever until you close it. The first message will not be repeated as this is usualy the mission-start message and should only be sent once.

`dcsbios_data.json` This file contains the logged data in hex format. If you are familiar with the format of dcs-bios messages, you may modify the file by hand if needed. The included sample file is a recording of the A-10C with a blinking Master Caution light.

### Software Developers

The [Developer Guide][developer-guide-url] explains how to connect to and interpret the DCS-BIOS export data stream and how to send commands to DCS-BIOS in order to operate controls inside the cockpit.

There are also a variety of client libraries available, including (but not limited to):
| Language | Library |
|-|-|
| C# | [DCS-BIOS Communicator](client-lib-dcs-bios-communicator-url) |

## Modules

> [!Note]
> Aircraft with multiple variants (e.g. A-10C/A-10C II, F-14A/B, etc.) are considered single modules.

Currently, DCS-BIOS supports the following aircraft modules:

### Adding a Mod

DCS-BIOS supports many community mods out-of-the-box.

In order to a Flaming-Cliffs-based mod which is not supported by DCS-BIOS, add the following to the bottom of `DCS-BIOS/lib/AircraftList.lua`:

```lua
add("PlaneName", false)
```
> [!Tip]
> To get the correct plane name, open the DCS-BIOS Reference Tool (`MetadataStart`) while you fly that plane and look what value `_ACFT_NAME` has.

> [!Important]
> Please consider submitting a pull request to add support for the module to DCS-BIOS for all users!
