####################### V 1.7.2.1:

security:
	fixed a possible heap buffer overflow in the readline address. This bug
	could be exploited when all of the following conditions were met:
	1) one of the addresses is READLINE without the noprompt and without the
	prompt options.
	2) the other (almost arbitrary address) reads malicious data (which is
	then transferred by socat to READLINE).
	Workaround: when using the READLINE address apply option prompt or
	noprompt.
	Full credits to Johan Thillemann for finding and reporting this issue.

####################### V 1.7.2.0:

corrections:
	when UNIX-LISTEN was applied to an existing file it failed as expected
	but removed the file. Thanks to Bjoern Bosselmann for reporting this
	problem

	fixed a bug where socat might crash when connecting to a unix domain
	socket using address GOPEN. Thanks to Martin Forssen for bug report and
	patch.

	UDP-LISTEN would alway set SO_REUSEADDR even without fork option and
	when user set it to 0. Thanks to Michal Svoboda for reporting this bug.

	UNIX-CONNECT did not support half-close. Thanks to Greg Hughes who
	pointed me to that bug

	TCP-CONNECT with option nonblock reported successful connect even when
	it was still pending

	address option ioctl-intp failed with "unimplemented type 26". Thanks
	to Jeremy W. Sherman for reporting and fixing that bug

	socat option -x did not print packet direction, timestamp etc; thanks
	to Anthony Sharobaiko for sending a patch

	address PTY does not take any parameters but did not report an error
	when some were given

	Marcus Meissner provided a patch that fixes invalid output and possible
	process crash when socat prints info about an unnamed unix domain
	socket

	Michal Soltys reported the following problem and provided an initial
	patch: when socat was interrupted, e.g. by SIGSTOP, and resumed during
	data transfer only parts of the data might have been written.

	Option o-nonblock in combination with large transfer block sizes
	may result in partial writes and/or EAGAIN errors that were not handled
	properly but resulted in data loss or process termination.

	Fixed a bug that could freeze socat when during assembly of a log
	message a signal was handled that also printed a log message. socat
	development had been aware that localtime() is not thread safe but had
	only expected broken messages, not corrupted stack (glibc 2.11.1,
	Ubuntu 10.4)

	an internal store for child pids was susceptible to pid reuse which
	could lead to sporadic data loss when both fork option and exec address
	were used. Thanks to Tetsuya Sodo for reporting this problem and
	sending a patch

	OpenSSL server failed with "no shared cipher" when using cipher aNULL.
	Fixed by providing temporary DH parameters. Thanks to Philip Rowlands
	for drawing my attention to this issue.

	UDP-LISTEN slept 1s after accepting a connection. This is not required.
	Thanks to Peter Valdemar Morch for reporting this issue

	fixed a bug that could lead to error or socat crash after a client
	connection with option retry had been established

	fixed configure.in bug on net/if.h check that caused IF_NAMESIZE to be
	undefined

	improved dev_t print format definition

porting:
	Cedril Priscal ported socat to Android (using Googles cross compiler).
	The port includes the socat_buildscript_for_android.sh script

	added check for component ipi_spec_dst in struct in_pktinfo so
	compilation does not fail on Cygwin (thanks to Peter Wagemans for
	reporting this problem)

	build failed on RHEL6 due to presence of fips.h; configure now checks
	for fipsld too. Thanks to Andreas Gruenbacher for reporting this
	problem

	check for netinet6/in6.h only when IPv6 is available and enabled

	don't fail to compile when the following defines are missing:
	IPV6_PKTINFO IPV6_RTHDR IPV6_DSTOPTS IPV6_HOPOPTS IPV6_HOPLIMIT
	Thanks to Jerry Jacobs for reporting this problem (Mac OS X Lion 10.7)

	check if define __APPLE_USE_RFC_2292 helps to enable IPV6_* (MacOSX
	Lion 7.1); thanks to Jerry Jacobs to reporting this problem and
	proposing a solution

	fixed compiler warnings on Mac OS X 64bit. Thanks to Guy Harris for
	providing the patch.

	corrections for OpenEmbedded, especially termios SHIFT values and
	ISPEED/OSPEED. Thanks to John Faith for providing the patch

	on Openmoko SHR

	fixed sa_family_t compile error on DragonFly. Thanks to Tony Young for
	reporting this issue and sending a patch.

	added option max-children that limits the number of concurrent child
	processes. Thanks to Sam Liddicott for providing the patch.

	Till Maas added support for tun/tap addresses without IP address
 
	added an option openssl-compress that allows to disable the compression
	feature of newer OpenSSL versions. Thanks to Michael Hanselmann for
	providing this contribution (sponsored by Google Inc.)

docu:
	minor corrections in docu (thanks to Paggas)

	client process -> child process

####################### V 1.7.1.3:

security:
	fixed a stack overflow vulnerability that occurred when command
	line arguments (whole addresses, host names, file names) were longer
	than 512 bytes.
	Note that this could only be exploited when an attacker was able to
	inject data into socat's command line.
	Full credits to Felix GrÃ¶bert, Google Security Team, for finding and
	reporting this issue

####################### V 1.7.1.2:

corrections:
	user-late and group-late, when applied to a pty, affected the system
	device /dev/ptmx instead of the pty (thanks to Matthew Cloke for
	pointing me to this bug)

	socats openssl addresses failed with "nonblocking operation did not
	complete" when the peer performed a renegotiation. Thanks to Benjamin

	Kayser for providing the patches)

	on some 64bit systems a compiler warning "cast from pointer to integer
	of different size" was issued on some option definitions

	added struct sockaddr_ll to union sockaddr_union to avoid "strict
	aliasing" warnings (problem reported by Paul Wouters)

docu:
	minor corrections in docu

####################### V 1.7.1.1:

corrections:
	corrected the "fixed possible SIGSEGV" fix because SIGSEGV still might
	occur under those conditions. Thanks to Toni Mattila for first
	reporting this problem.

	ftruncate64 cut its argument to 32 bits on systems with 32 bit long type

	socat crashed on systems without setenv() (esp. SunOS up to Solaris 9);
	thanks to Todd Stansell for reporting this bug

	with unidirectional EXEC and SYSTEM a close() operation was performed
	on a random number which could result in hanging e.a.

	fixed a compile problem caused by size_t/socklen_t mismatch on 64bit
	systems

	docu mentioned option so-bindtodev but correct name is so-bindtodevice. 
	Thanks to Jim Zimmerman for reporting.

docu changes:
	added environment variables example to doc/socat-multicast.html

####################### V 1.7.1.0:

new features:
	address options shut-none, shut-down, and shut-close allow to control
	socat's half close behaviour

	with address option shut-null socat sends an empty packet to the peer
	to indicate EOF

	option null-eof changes the behaviour of sockets that receive an empty
	packet to see EOF instead of ignoring it

	introduced option names substuser-early and su-e, currently equivalent
	to option substuser (thanks to Mike Perry for providing the patch)

corrections:
	fixed some typos and improved some comments

####################### V 1.7.0.1:

corrections:
	fixed possible SIGSEGV in listening addresses when a new connection was
	reset by peer before the socket addresses could be retrieved. Thanks to
	Mike Perry for sending a patch.

	fixed a bug, introduced with version 1.7.0.0, that let client
	connections with option connect-timeout fail when the connections
	succeeded. Thanks to Bruno De Fraine for reporting this bug.

	option end-close "did not apply" to addresses PTY, SOCKET-CONNECT,
	and most UNIX-* and ABSTRACT-*

	half close of EXEC and SYSTEM addresses did not work for pipes and
	sometimes socketpair

	help displayed for some option a wrong type

	under some circumstances shutdown was called multiple times for the
	same fd

####################### V 1.7.0.0:

new features:
	new address types SCTP-CONNECT and SCTP-LISTEN implement SCTP stream
	mode for IPv4 and IPv6; new address options sctp-maxseg and
	sctp-nodelay (suggested by David A. Madore; thanks to Jonathan Brannan
	for providing an initial patch)

	new address "INTERFACE" for transparent network interface handling
	(suggested by Stuart Nicholson)

	added generic socket addresses: SOCKET-CONNECT, SOCKET-LISTEN,
	SOCKET-SENDTO, SOCKET-RECVFROM, SOCKET-RECV, SOCKET-DATAGRAM allow
	protocol independent socket handling; all parameters are explicitely
	specified as numbers or hex data

	added address options ioctl-void, ioctl-int, ioctl-intp, ioctl-string,
	ioctl-bin for generic ioctl() calls.

	added address options setsockopt-int, setsockopt-bin, and
	setsockopt-string for generic setsockopt() calls

	option so-type now only affects the socket() and socketpair() calls,
	not the name resolution. so-type and so-prototype can now be applied to
	all socket based addresses.

	new address option "escape" allows to break a socat instance even when
	raw terminal mode prevents ^C etc. (feature suggested by Guido Trotter)

	socat sets environment variables SOCAT_VERSION, SOCAT_PID, SOCAT_PPID
	for use in executed scripts

	socat sets environment variables SOCAT_SOCKADDR, SOCAT_SOCKPORT,
	SOCAT_PEERADDR, SOCAT_PEERPORT in LISTEN type addresses (feature
	suggested by Ed Sawicki)

	socat receives all ancillary messages with each received packet on
	datagram related addresses. The messages are logged in raw form with
	debug level, and broken down with info level. note: each type of
	ancillary message must be enabled by appropriate address options. 

	socat provides the contents of ancillary messages received on RECVFROM
	addresses in appropriate environment variables:
	SOCAT_TIMESTAMP, SOCAT_IP_DSTADDR, SOCAT_IP_IF, SOCAT_IP_LOCADDR,
	SOCAT_IP_OPTIONS, SOCAT_IP_TOS, SOCAT_IP_TTL, SOCAT_IPV6_DSTADDR,
	SOCAT_IPV6_HOPLIMIT, SOCAT_IPV6_TCLASS

	the following address options were added to enable ancillary messages:
	so-timestamp, ip-pktinfo (not BSD), ip-recvdstaddr (BSD), ip-recverr,
	ip-recvif (BSD), ip-recvopts, ip-recvtos, ip-recvttl, ipv6-recvdstopts,
	ipv6-recverr, ipv6-recvhoplimit, ipv6-recvhopopts, ipv6-recvpathmtu,
	ipv6-recvpktinfo, ipv6-recvrthdr, ipv6-recvtclass

	new address options ipv6-tclass and ipv6-unicast-hops set the related
	socket options.

	STREAMS (UNIX System V STREAMS) can be configured with the new address
	options i-pop-all and i-push (thanks to Michal Rysavy for providing a
	patch)

corrections:
	some raw IP and UNIX datagram modes failed on BSD systems

	when UDP-LISTEN continued to listen after packet dropped by, e.g.,
	range option, the old listen socket would not be closed but a new one
	created. open sockets could accumulate.

	there was a bug in ip*-recv with bind option: it did not bind, and
	with the first received packet an error occurred:
	socket_init(): unknown address family 0
	test: RAWIP4RECVBIND

	RECVFROM addresses with FORK option hung after processing the first
	packet. test: UDP4RECVFROM_FORK

	corrected a few mistakes that caused compiler warnings on 64bit hosts
	(thanks to Jonathan Brannan e.a. for providing a patch)

	EXEC and SYSTEM with stderr injected socat messages into the data
	stream. test: EXECSTDERRLOG

	when the EXEC address got a string with consecutive spaces it created
	additional empty arguments (thanks to Olivier Hervieu for reporting
	this bug). test: EXECSPACES

	in ignoreeof polling mode socat also blocked data transfer in the other
	direction during the 1s wait intervalls (thanks to Jorgen Cederlof for
	reporting this bug)

	corrected alphabetical order of options (proxy-auth)

	some minor corrections

	improved test.sh script: more stable timing, corrections for BSD

	replaced the select() calls by poll() to cleanly fix the problems with
	many file descriptors already open

	socat option -lf did not log to file but to stderr

	socat did not compile on Solaris when configured without termios
	feature (thanks to Pavan Gadi for reporting this bug)

porting:
	socat compiles and runs on AIX with gcc (thanks to Andi Mather for his
	help)

	socat compiles and runs on Cygwin (thanks to Jan Just Keijser for his
	help)

	socat compiles and runs on HP-UX with gcc (thanks to Michal Rysavy for
	his help)

	(thanks to James Sainsbury for reporting this problem)

	socat would hang when invoked with many file descriptors already opened
	fix: replaced FOPEN_MAX with FD_SETSIZE
	thanks to Daniel Lucq for reporting this problem.

	process did not catch SIGCHLD. this affected addresses UDP-LISTEN,
	UDP-CONNECT, TCP-CONNECT, OPENSSL, PROXY, UNIX-CONNECT, UNIX-CLIENT,
	ABSTRACT-CONNECT, ABSTRACT-CLIENT, SOCKSA, SOCKS4A
	(thanks to Fernanda G Weiden for reporting this problem)

	fixed a bug where sub processes would become zombies because the master
	process caught SIGCHLD but did not wait(). this affected addresses

	(thanks to Evan Borgstrom for reporting this problem)

	corrected option handling with STDIO; usecase: cool-write

	configure --disable-pty  also disabled option waitlock

	EPIPE condition could result in a 100% CPU loop

further changes:
	support systems without SHUT_RD etc.
	handle more size_t types
	try to find makedepend options with gcc 3 (richard/OpenMacNews)

####################### V 1.4.2.0:

	making it more robust in "unsupported" environments

	server.pem permissions corrected to 600

	"make install" now does not strip; use "make strip; make install"
	if you like strip (suggested by Peter Bray)

solved problems and bugs:
	PROBLEM: OPENSSL did not apply tcp, ip, and socket options
	SOLVED: OPENSSL now correctly handles the options list

new features:
	proxy connect with optional proxy authentication

	combined hex and text dump mode, credits to Gregory Margo

	address pty applies options user, group, and perm to device

	PROBLEM: option reuseport was not applied (BSD, AIX)
	SOLVED:	option reuseport now in phase PASTSOCKET instead of PREBIND,
		credits to Jean-Baptiste Marchand

	PROBLEM: ignoreeof with stdio was ignored
	SOLVED: ignoreeof now works correctly with address stdio

	PROBLEM: ftp.sh did not use user supplied password
	SOLVED: ftp.sh now correctly passes password from command line

	PROBLEM: server.pem had expired
	SOLVED: new server.pem valid for ten years

new features:
	address pty for putting socat behind a new pseudo terminal that may
	fake a serial line, modem etc.

	experimental openssl integration
	(it does not provide any trust between the peers because is does not
	 check certificates!)

	locking mechanism provided by flock()

	options setsid and setpgid now available with all address types

		check if the slash is before the first ',' before assuming
		implicit GOPEN.


porting:

further corrections:
	with -d -d -d -d -D, don't print debug info during file analysis


####################### V 1.1.0.1:

new features:
	.spec file for RPM generation


solved problems and bugs:
	PROBLEM: GOPEN on socket did not apply option unlink-late
	SOLUTION: GOPEN for socket now applies group NAMED, phase PASTOPEN
		options 

	PROBLEM: with unidirectional mode, an unnecessary close timeout was
		applied
	SOLUTION: in unidirectional mode, terminate without wait time

	PROBLEM: using GOPEN on a unix domain socket failed for datagram
		sockets
	SOLUTION: when connect() fails with EPROTOTYPE, use a datagram socket


further corrections:

	open() flag options had names starting with "o_", now corrected to "o-"

	in docu, *-listen addresses were called *_listen

	address unix now called unix-connect because it does not handle unix
	datagram sockets

	in test.sh, apply global command line options with all tests

	procan prints rlimit infos


solved problems and bugs:
	PROBLEM: raw IP socket SIGSEGV'ed when it had been shut down.
	SOLVED: set eof flag of channel on shutdown.

	PROBLEM: if channel 2 uses a single non-socket FD in bidirectional mode
		and has data available while channel 1 reaches EOF, the data is
		lost. 
	SOLVED: during one loop run, first handle all data transfers and
		_afterwards_ handle EOF. 

	PROBLEM: despite to option NONBLOCK, the connect() call blocked
	SOLVED: option NONBLOCK is now applied in phase FD instead of LATE

	PROBLEM: UNLINK options issued error when file did not exist,
		terminating socat
	SOLVED: failure of unlink() is only warning if errno==ENOENT

	PROBLEM: TCP6-LISTEN required numeric port specification
	SOLVED: now uses common TCP service resolver

	PROBLEM: with PIPE, wrong FDs were shown for data transfer loop
	SOLVED: retrieval of FDs now pays respect to PIPE pecularities

	PROBLEM: using address EXEC against an address with IGNOREEOF, socat
		never terminated
	SOLVED: corrected EOF handling of sigchld


porting:
	MacOS and old AIX versions now have pty

	flock() now available on Linux (configure check was wrong)

	named pipe were generated using mknod(), which requires root under BSD
	now they are generated using mkfifo

	available 

	option BINDTODEVICE now also called SO-BINDTODEVICE, IF

	"make install" now installs binaries with ownership 0:0


####################### V 1.0.4.2:

solved problems and bugs:
	PROBLEM: EOF of one stream caused close of other stream, giving it no
	chance to go down regularly
	SOLVED: EOF of one stream now causes shutdown of write part of other
	stream

	PROBLEM: sending mail via socks address to qmail showed that crlf
	option does not work
	SOLVED: socks address applies PH_LATE options

	PROBLEM: in debug mode, no info about socat and platform was issued
	SOLVED: print socat version and uname output in debug mode

	PROBLEM: invoking socat with -t and no following parameters caused
	SIGSEGV
	SOLVED: -t and -b now check next argv entry

	PROBLEM: when opening of logfile (-lf) failed, no error was reported
	and no further messages were printed
	SOLVED: check result of fopen and print error message if it failed

new features:
	address type UDP-LISTEN now supports option fork: it internally applies
	socket option SO_REUSEADDR so a new UDP socket can bind to port after
	`accepting´ a connection (child processes might live forever though)
	(suggestion from Damjan Lango)


####################### V 1.0.4.1:

solved problems and bugs:
	PROB: assert in libc caused an endless recursion
	SOLVED: no longer catch SIGABRT

	PROB: socat printed wrong verbose prefix for "right to left" packets
	SOLVED: new parameter for xiotransfer() passes correct prefix

	before Gethostbyname, invoke inet_aton for MacOSX


####################### V 1.0.3.0:

solved problems and bugs:

	PROB: test 9 of test.sh (echo via file) failed on some platforms,
	socat exited without error message
	SOLVED: _xioopen_named_early(): preset statbuf.st_mode with 0

	PROB: test 17 hung forever
	REASON: child death before select loop did not result in EOF
	SOLVED: check of existence of children before starting select loop

	PROB: test 17 failed
	REASON: child dead triggered EOF before last data was read
	SOLVED: after child death, read last data before setting EOF

	PROB: filan showed that exec processes incorrectly had fd3 open
	REASON: inherited open fd3 from main process
	SOLVED: set CLOEXEC flag on pty fd in main process

	PROB: help printed "undef" instead of group "FORK"
	SOLVED: added "FORK" to group name array

	PROB: fatal messages did not include severity classifier
