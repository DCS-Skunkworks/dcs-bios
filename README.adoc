== DCS-Skunkworks DCS-BIOS

DCS-BIOS is a `Export.lua` file for use with http://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/[DCS: World].
It provides a stable, documented interface for external hardware and software to interact with the clickable cockpit of a DCS: World aircraft.

This Version is a fork of the older Version of https://github.com/dcs-bios/dcs-bios[DCS-BIOS] created and programmed by https://github.com/jboecker[jboecker]
We have this older Version improved and updated to meet todays state of DCS: World

This Version is not only for DCS-Skunkworks, its like the normal DCS-BIOS version before the BIOS-HUB versions.
Works also for Pit Builders and Arduino users!

  If want to support us, You find infos at the bottom of this page!
  With that money, we buy the planes to integrade them in Flightpanel DCS-BIOS fork.

- Release/Prerelease are mostly for the stable version of DCS.
- DCS Beta Users should use the ```DCS-BIOS Openbeta``` nightly release. Starting a mission will generate the json files.
- Arduino Users should download the `Source code(zip)` on the Release page to get all needed files
- Flightpanel users download the `DCS-BIOS_0.7.XXX.zip`

Problems/Infos see our Wiki: https://github.com/DCS-Skunkworks/dcs-bios/wiki[DCS-Skunkworks DCS-BIOS Wiki]

== For Panel Builders

You don't need to be a programmer or electrical engineer.
The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/userguide.{link-ext}[DCS-BIOS User Guide] will show you step by step how to connect your panel to DCS using DCS-BIOS and the beginner-friendly http://arduino.cc[Arduino microcontroller platform].
You don't have to write any program code yourself.

== For Software Developers

The link:Scripts/DCS-BIOS/doc/developerguide.{link-ext}[Developer Guide] explains how to connect to and interpret the DCS-BIOS export data stream and how to send commands to DCS-BIOS to operate controls inside the cockpit.

  Use always the latest version of the Mods!

  For DCS Flightpanels:
  FC3 are only supported with Keyemulator. But some Exports can made as Strings (FC3.lua) and CommonData

If you want to add support for another module, please get in touch.(see below)

== For Hardware Developers

If you are working a lot with hardware, it may come in handy to log and replay dcs-bios data. There are two scripts in `\Programs\tools` that allow you to do so.

`python connect-logger.py` will log all dcs-bios data to `dcsbios_data.json`. Ensure that you start the logger before loading a mission, to capture the mission-start message properly.

`python replay-log.py` will ask for a serial port like `connect-serial-port.cmd` and replay the data to that com-port. When it reaches the end of the file, it will loop forever until you close it. The first message will not be repeated as this is usualy the mission-start message and should only be sent once.

`dcsbios_data.json` This file contains the logged data in hex format. If you are familiar with the format of dcs-bios messages, you may modify the file by hand if needed. The included sample file is a recording of the A-10C with a blinking Master Caution light.

== Mod Support

If you want to add a FC3 based Mod (eg. VSN_Mod Planes) for commondata suport, you must follow
these instructions:

Add at the bottom  in \DCS-BIOS\lib\AircraftList.lua

a("PlaneName", false)

To get the correct Plane Name, open the control-reference page while you fly that plane.
In MetadataStat you find the Plane Name.

== socat

There are 2 socat versions, 32 and 64 bit. Choose that version that fits best for you.
The files in the zip File must be unzipped direct in the socat folder.

  The path must be: /socat/socat.exe
